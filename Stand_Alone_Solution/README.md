This folder contains the working stand alone code.
Sample articles have been included to test on.


Assumptions:

This folder is loaded in the root folder of a default WordPress directory so it has access to wp-load.php
The php.ini has fopen() flag set to on so it can open and read files.
It is on a windows pc running on the Local by flywheel system.
PHP 7.4+ is installed
Current version of MySql
Nginx as a web server

It may work on other LAMP stack setups like DDEV or Lando or xampp etc.

Please join this project and help refactor this to better code and eventually turn this into a Actual WordPress Plugin.
