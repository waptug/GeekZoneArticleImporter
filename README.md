ToDo:

Re-Factor into OPP style code.

Populate plugin template with working code.

Grab keywords from file and add them as tags to the post.

Grab Folder names from directory and add them as categories of post

Insure file is in UTF8 so odd charecters don't get left out or converted incorrectly or deal with the char set of the file natively for non utf8 types.

Automate searching and uploading for stock photos from unsplash based on categorie and keywords to populate the article and set as featuered image of the post

Create UI for plugin admin for selecting various settings.

Create a way to import a folder of articles into the wp-content/uploads and maintain the folder nesting structure so the parsing will pick up the parent/child relationships of the 
 categories and keywords.

Create UI for admin to monitor and control progress of file uploading to manage time outs for large article sets.

Create a general free form parser to analyse non standard flat file formats to allow for broder use case importing.

Create a way to add on to plugin with file format templates for various file types of other flat file cms systems.

Once this is working post to WordPress plugin directory at https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/
